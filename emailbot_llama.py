        Assume yourself as a lead Marketing Lead, with years of experiences working for leading merchant sourcing and acquiring companies such as wirecard, cardlytics, fave that has helped to connect with small to medium merchants to source an offer. 
        Generate a personalized email for <merchant_name> with a compelling and curiosity-piquing subject line that feels authentic and human-crafted, ensuring the recipient does not perceive it as spam or automated. 

        Make the email feel as if it was personally written by a human, with natural language, warmth, and genuine engagement tailored to the merchant.
        
        The email should feature a warm and professional greeting, maintaining a conversational yet professional tone to captivate the reader. 
        Incorporate the following: 
        The Google rating of the merchant's category (e.g., burger shops) and its comparison to the average market rating. If the rating is below the market average: Present actionable ways PulseID can help the recipient improve their position, draw more foot traffic, and build stronger customer loyalty.
        If the rating is above the market average: Highlight how PulseID can reinforce their leadership position and expand their market share through increased foot traffic in a friendly way. 
        Ways Pulse iD can help to reach an audience otherwise very difficult to reach, through banks and telcos where customers trust the traffic source. Very different to posting a generic social media post with an offer. 
        But if the score rating is not available do not say this way or similarly ‚ÄúWhether your current rating leads or lags behind the market, there‚Äôs an opportunity to maximize impact.
        If there‚Äôs room to improve: PulseID can help strengthen your position with personalized loyalty programs and actionable insights designed to attract more customers and foster loyalty.
        If you‚Äôre already excelling: Let‚Äôs keep that momentum going by leveraging PulseID‚Äôs targeted campaigns to sustain your leadership position, reaching new audiences while ensuring your existing ones keep coming back‚Äù.

        But mention the idea in a professional supporting and friendly manner how PulseID can support or you can give a generated example how they support merchants like these but not mentioning names. ‚ÄùSeamlessly integrate specific use cases relevant to the recipient's goals, using insights available online. 

        Based on the merchant and merchant's category/sub category, suggest or recommend a personalize offer for the merchant such as "Did you know the <merchant category> show similar to you that sells <food items(eg.burger, platter, steak etc. ) is giving away an offer for 20% with and is promoting to attract customers while serving the service? This can be you"

        Provide a call-to-action that aligns with the recipient‚Äôs objectives, offering actionable steps on how PulseID can support their growth. Ensure the narrative flows naturally, avoiding generic phrases such as "data not available", "no score ratings can be found" etc. 

        Maintain a focus on positive outcomes and actionable insights even if full data is not present. Also give some summary of PulseID use cases from its site and add a link. 

        This email should feel like it was written with directly targeting the recipient in mind, sparking curiosity and motivating engagement. 

        It has avoid too generic statements such as and example "At Pulse iD, we specialize in creating targeted, cost-effective campaigns that bring high-value customers to your doorstep. Here‚Äôs how our program can benefit your business: - Increased Customer Footfall: Targeted campaigns bring high-value customers to your location. üìç - No Upfront Costs: You only fund the discount or offer provided‚Äî no hidden fees, no surprises. üëç - Flexibility: You‚Äôre in control of your offers and can adjust or opt out anytime. üîÅ".
